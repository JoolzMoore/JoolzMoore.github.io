      <strong>Using insight as a technique for growing trust and sincerity</strong><br>
      To be able to understand and accept anothers feelings without necessarily agreeing to them. It is a litle like a restorative justice process. I have experienced this as a board member within board meetings. Governance is all about listening to the many viewpoints and bringing people into the centre of the process. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Loving kindness meditation </strong><br>
      Compassion and empathy should be so good that it spreads like wildfire - as it is all really about us wanting the best for others. And it always ends up coming back to affect you in some form or another. It is about thinking beyond our own wellbeing, consciously thinking about others and being positive towards strangers. With continual practice it creates better intergroup processes and effective learning relationships by changing attitudes. I do try to link the ideas and concepts of others and try to represent the various parts of the community I have been involved with. Ioften spend lots of time thinking about this, pondering and writing things down, I guess this is a type of meditation?.<br>

      <strong>Learning to use political awareness: </strong><br>
      > Maintaining rich personal networks within organisations and groups. Find those that support and challenge you.<br>
      > Practice reading and understanding the underlying currents and values of any organisation, and how decisions are made. Who or what influences the decions?<br>
      > Distinguishing your own self-interest from that of the team or organisation.<br>
      > Using self-awareness to understand your role and persoanlity within interactions.<br>
      <br>

      <strong>A situation where I experienced some conflict or disagreement</strong><br>
       I was president of a community Playcentre and we were about to do an outdoor building project which used treated wood. We had been fundraising for this for years, with many past members having already done the planning, and design we were finally about to begin building. We had the builder all ready to go ahead, but some parents in the centre were against using the treated wood for the decking as it was considered to be harmful to young children. I was unsure how to proceed, as all decisions in the centre were done on a consensus basis and now we did not have it. I could understand both positions. We needed the treated wood as it was a slippery deck area surrounded the trees in winter and any other wood would rot and not be approved by Council. Also, we could not afford to use an imported and unsustainable hardwood, this was against our values as well. I could equally understand that wood impregnated with arsenic could be unsafe for young children who do tend to lick and suck things as part of their exploratory growth experiences. We used empathetic listening and then went to get further information before making our decision. One of the members wrote to an expert from the university for their advice. We shared the response with all members, and only then did we feel we had the tools and advcie to make a consensus decision. We all decided to go ahead with building works as planned.
