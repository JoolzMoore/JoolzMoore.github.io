    <h1>Emotional intelligence </h1>
    <h3>Date: 2 April 2016</h3>

    <p>
    <b>What is emotional intelligence and how it is developed?</b>
    <br>It can be developed by paying attention to what is happening in the brain, and by moderating responses and eventually changing the way the brain works. All emotional states have a physiological core, so we can understand them and be in control physically as well as mentally. Emotional intelligence is about refining emotions, and making the brain and body work together.
    <p>
    <b>Benefits of emotional intelligence</b>
    <br>Better work performance, building leadership qualities, and the ability to create your own happiness.
    <p>
    <b>Techniques and practices for improving emotional intelligence</b>
    <br>The brain is active and has built-in nueroplasticity, so it has the inherent ability to change and grow.  If we pay attention to changes, and foster a growth mindset, the brain will follow.  How? Be alert, but also relaxed. Be clear about our values, priorities and goals and focusson mind thoughts that are not all about yourself.
    <p>
    <b>How to develop a basic mindfulness practice?</b>
    <br>Regain attentional focus - the way you view yourself. By using a constructive and healthy ways to create opportunities. It begins with self-processing emotions and re-ordering brain systems, to help recognise what mode you are in, and to watch subtle changes in emotion. The ability to modulate or to have clarity allows us more space for empathy for others.
