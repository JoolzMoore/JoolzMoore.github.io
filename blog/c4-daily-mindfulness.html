     <h4>
      Daily mindfulness
      </h4>

      <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong><br>
      I have practised this before in a peer mediation course, in order to be more fully present within a conversation and to help concentrate on anothers position and situation. It helps form a bond with people as you link with them and truly feel more about their ideas, putting yourself in their shoes. It also helps reduce your own stress whilst you focus on others. I tried it with my husband and he truly though something was up when I said can we sit down and talk after dinner. I usually scuttle off to do some work, I so he was looking serious when I asked about his day. It looks like I need to increase the number of times I do this, so my conversations are more mindful with my husband. The comment after the conversation was that it was great to be listened to so fully.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>  Which of the techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong><br>
      Appling all my attention to what the other person says, and bing quiet, not judging or bringing in emotions. Also removing all the thoughts I have and stop the 'self-talk' when you start  thinking about what you are going to say or do next. Repeating back what you heard in a sentence which adapts what you understood, is a good way to evaluate that the essence of any concept has been communicated well. This is a good learning tool, and helps make things clear.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>  Other musings?</strong><br>To keep reminding myself to find some calm time and to use these skills more often. It doesn't take much for the mind to wander from your desired path.<br>
