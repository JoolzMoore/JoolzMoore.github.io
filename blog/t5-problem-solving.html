     <h4>
      Problem solving
      </h4>
     <br>
     <p class="blogbody"><strong>Date:</strong> 27 April<strong>  Updated:</strong>  29 June 2016<br><br>
      <strong>A simple problem, and a problem solved in an elegant way.</strong><br>
       I have experienced how to get blocked in a myriad of ways:  writing variables, what is the meaning of.map and trying to understand recursion. It can all suck up hours if you get lost in the world googling for information and trying to find the many ways a problem can be explained. I had a hard time with the instructions and the syntax requirements needed in CodeAcademy. as self-learning is stressful. Sometimes all you need is to go away from the screen, have a break and come back and re-read the question again. For me the most elegant is when I am at my most time-efficient. So lately I have decided that I do not have large amounts of blocked time, so that any half hour can be used to solve s a question or two. A good night's sleep will help, as things look different in the morning.The most elegant way I aspire to is to create the most succint code that akes sense to most. I don't think I am at all there yet!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>  Some of the techniques I use to sustain practice?</strong><br>
      Break it down. So far it is hundreds of small tiny steps. I guess the explaining in detail amd good communication is neccesssary bit. We're still learning how to describe and share code experiences. In coding, little urgencies or syntax errors appear from nowhere, and the feedback loop has to be fast. I need to find a faster way to share and get the feedback, so I can continue faster. We are all sharing experience in order to progess with learning how to code.  .<br>
      <br>
      <strong>  Other musings?</strong><br>To keep reminding myself to find some calm time and to use these skills more often. It doesn't take much for the mind to wander from your desired path.<br>
      <br>
      <strong> What was felt throughout the process? What was learnt? </strong><br>
      Coding shouldn't be different to my other life experiences.Sometimes I'm thankfull for being able to achieve the unexpected, at other times I'm definitely in the lowest  part of the dip. What you learn is to never give up, keep trying to find an alternative way. When you are really stuck you try almost anything. So I'm still plodding on with the coding in my own way and hopefully will learn ways to improve as I go. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>> Pseudocode:</strong>
      This is a new revelation for me as a beginner. I have been taking notes, but sometimes I forget what it all means later. What I needed was a literal translation amongst the code which would translate it, so when I read it again it has it in a strange English, but it makes sense. This is how you often learn languages. <br>
      <strong>> Just trying something:</strong><br>
      Take a bit of code out, does it make a difference? What does the code actually do? Check it out. Console.log it. <br>
      <strong>> Reading error messages:</strong><br>
      I've console.logged a whole compilation of short-lined poetry - probably far more elegant than my code. It has lots of repetitive sentences for emphasis, usually including the word 'error' = oh well!. It is a lesson in going through each section line by line to check thoroughly and work out if it is any of those recurring mistakes that I seem to specialise in, or a new one! <br>
      <strong>> Ask for help:</strong><br>
      Any friend who knows anything remotely web-based has been pestered by me many times now. Neighbours, ex work mates, family, And what relief when you finally ask a question that has been bugging you. I saveg the best tricky ones for the teachers, and the cohort, the lovely cohort we have already shared our collective understanding and problems. I haven't run out of silly mistakes to share and have loads of twisted syntax tangles to unravel yet. <br>
      <strong>> Goofing it, and then googling it:</strong><br>
      Every mistake and error must have been done before, so there can't be anything that is still unGoogled - can there? <br>
       <strong>> There are more I haven't tried yet:</strong><br>
      The rubber ducky method, and improving with reflection. I am sure they will all be used in time. <br>
      <br>
      <strong> > Some functions I've googled:</strong> <br>
      <strong>> .map ()</strong> <br>
      arr.map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results. Callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values, including undefined. <br>
      <strong>> .filter( )</strong> <br>
      This filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.<br>
      <strong>> .reduce( )</strong> <br>
      The reduce( ) method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right)â€¦left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.
