             <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>
             <br>
              Shifting the attention of your emotions and modulating them, so you are processing the view of yourself without emotions hijac
              king your experiences. Choosing your experiwnces withour compulsion.

              <strong>Self awareness practice  </strong>
               <br>One good practise is to use the body scan to understand feelings as they arise. Accept emotions, and be wiling to experience them with with curiosity and humour.

              <strong>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</strong>
              <br>Arrays let you create and group together data in interesting ways. Arrays are not a new data type, but lists with data values.

              <strong>Take-aways:</strong>
              Shifting the attention from the power of emotion. We can use the clarity of our values instead of our feelings. I like the example of the person riding the runaway horse. The person has no mastery over their emotions and where they want to go. They let the horse choose and have to hold on, and follow by compulsion, not by freedom of their choice.
