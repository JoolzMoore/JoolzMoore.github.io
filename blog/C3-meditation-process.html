              <strong>Has the process over product concept affected the way I redisigned and rebuilt my website?</strong><br>
              I often mention to others to have a go and that the process is everything, but can I adhere to my own advice? Not really! I try to do everything as best I can, as the way I was brought up - outcomes were important. As a designer i want to improve the experience every time, or why would I work on a project? But as a mum, so many plans are made, but not fulfilled, life happens!  I have to remember this course is for me to learn and I should be like the children at preschool - getting my hands all sticky and gooey and covered in an experience - and just give myself the space and to redefine what finishing a project actually means to me. At whatever pace, I have to be happy with what I can get done in the time I currently have available. It is about experimenting and learning with everything new.
              <br>
              <strong>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</strong><br>
              I immediately thought that I have tried to do it, and I know I'm not very good at it! Years ago, I attended a whole yoga class where we all sat cross-legged, eyes closed, and other people semmed to be serene and free of thoughts. But the whole time my mind was racing with a crazy amoint of ideas, thoughts and yet more planning of projects to do. I alaway thoughht that if I opened my mind and closed eyes and let it all go, that the end result was that I would just fall asleep.

              <br>
              <strong>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</strong><br>
              Giuseppe Pagnoni's interesting research using an MRI machine to compare brain patterns in people with five years or more of established meditation practices with thoseo people who didn’t meditate. So interesting that he found meditators were better able to control their ventral posteromedial cortex, or the part of the brain that tends to wander and ruminate Also other research  by Jared RAmsburg about how meditation improved students’ retention of the information conveyed during the lecture. It is something the local Wananga was doing when I was taking Te Reo classes, They used this concept andalways  incorporated a section of the class to meditation before we got into the main learning for the evening.
              <br>
              <strong>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</strong><br>
              I need to embed a part of mindfulness in my everyday routine so it becomes easier to do it, I'm hoping, my running and yoga helps, but there is the weekend to get more focus, perhaps trying it at the same time every morning.
              The most interesting concept to ponder is the idea that there is no 'self'. That self is as much  a construct of the mind - just like the idea that 'the body is not me.'
