              Time and habits
            </h4>
             <p>

             <strong>What timebox and habits have I tried?</strong>
              <br>
              I have only just read this section, it's another brain soak. I have been told about a technique similar to the pomodoro technique from a sports movement specialist. It Swas slightly diferent. I been practicing working in one position for 50 minutes, then do something else for 10 minutes such as hanging out the washing or making a cup of tea. Then re-align the physical working position differently, so trying standing, kneeling, sitting cross-legged moving the laptop and working environment. It's all about doing what kids do well - wriggle and move alot as sitting static at desks is unnatural for long periods. It works on a total mental scale as well. We are in an intense period of changing behaviours and creating new habits whilst overloading our brains. Headbanging on the desk as a re-algnment method hasn't worked so far...

              <br>
              <strong>What did I find interesting?</strong>
              <br>That the curriculum involves much more than thinking and understanding systems, not just the systematic parts but how they work together to produce larger-scale effects. Holistic thinking and larger patterns and how we react to them all affects our learning. How we feel matters, so let's all try and manage things the best we can.

              <strong>What is working for me? </strong>
              <br>
              I am continually worling on it...there is always a much better way. As I am moving around the country heaps at the moment finding time and wifi has been a priority, but having the team to call on has been a great asset for me, and is working. Thanks everyone... So making it big by starting small is my mantra. Getting through stuff when I can. The normal working habits havent been able to be applied, but When I home I'll gradually start introducing new work habits ...

              <strong>What is working for me? </strong>
               <br>
               I need to start working ahead and skimming content of next stage when I am stuck, as I waste time in limbo... Also, do less, but better. I'm gradually trying to shake off other work, community commitments and those family house maintenance jobs in order to cope. I always wondered what the term 'lizard brainâ€™ meant and our resistance to stick our necks out. Using feedback and connection rather than criticism and opposition is probably the most crucial skill I need to work on!
