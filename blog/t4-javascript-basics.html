              Javascript basics
            </h4>
             <p>

             <strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong>
             <br>
              With HTML you mark-up or tag areas for the basic structure and content of a website, such as where the header , navigation and the many content areas will go. CSS is responsible for the design of the webpage - how every thing looks, and where it is on the page.  Javascript is a programming language which can change or animate items after the website loaded, and change  appearance o material in your broswer.<br>
              <br>

              <strong>Everyday control flow loop</strong>
               <br>if (hours < 10){<br>
               say(“Good morning.”);<br>
                  } else if {(hours >= 14 && hours <= 17);<br>
              document.write(“Good afternoon.”);<br>
                  } else if { (hours >= 17) say(“Good evening.”);<br
                  } else { say (“Good day.”).<br>
              The first statement checks the hours variable for a value less than 10—in other  words, it checks whether the current time is before 10:00 a.m. If so, it displays the  greeting “Good morning.”  The second statement checks whether the time is between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  and, if so, displays “Good afternoon.” This statement uses else if to indicate that  this condition will only be tested if the previous one failed—if it’s morning, there’s  no need to check whether it’s afternoon. Similarly, the third statement checks for  times after 5:00 p.m. and displays “Good evening.”  The final statement uses a simple else, meaning it will be executed if none of the  previous conditions matched. This covers the times between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00  p.m. (which is neglected by the other statements) and displays “Good day.”
              } <br>
               <br>

              <strong>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</strong>
              <br>Arrays let you create and group together data in interesting ways. Arrays are not a new data type, but lists with data values. Each value has an index, which is the numbered poistion of that value in the array. The first value us at index ), the next value is at index 1 etc. An Array is a subclass, or sub-prototype, of an Object, and it can inherit features from an Object. In JavaScript, an object literal is a comma separated list of named values wrapped in curly braces. It is created and has properties and methods added to it.
               <br><br>
              <strong>What is a function?</strong>
              <br>It is a way to bundle code so it can be re-used. Functions allow  us to run the same piece of code from multiple places in a programme without having to copy and paste the code repeatedly. Also, by hiding long bits of code in a function and giving it a name we will all recognise, will make it easier to able to plan the code and focus on organising the functions instead of multiples of coding detail.
