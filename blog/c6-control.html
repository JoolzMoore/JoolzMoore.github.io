             <p>
              <br>Find and create your own path for yourself. Learn and know your own strengths and limits, using your mind thoughts to perform optimally. Try not to react right away. Clarify the situation and find the real focus, which should change the response. Making a habit of the technique to stop, breathe, notice, reflect, and then respond. It should help with negative emotions, instead of being 'triggered' into self-sabotaging reactions.
              <br>
              <br> <strong>Competencies to utilise:</strong>
              <br>
              <br> <strong> > Self-control:</strong><br>
              We all could benefit from letting go negative emotions, and not'feeding the monsters'
              <br>
              <br> <strong> > Trustworthiness: </strong><br>
              Acceptance, honesty and integrity. Being sensitive to your own and others changes in the paralymbic brain cortex. Having a non-judgemental attitude.
              <br>
              <br> <strong> >Conscientiousness: </strong><br>
              Having responsibility for personal performance. Managing impulses and internal states to perform optimally.
               <br>
              <br> <strong> > Adaptability: </strong><br>
              Flexibility to handle change, attention deployment, re-interpreting, accepting emotions with humour and curiosity.
              <br>
              <br> <strong>  > Innovation: </strong><br>
              Using many diferent methods, striving, trying new approaches and testing strategic ideas.
              <br>
              <br> <strong>My current mindfulness:</strong>
              <br>
              I use exercise and yoga as therapy to tune into my body and be kind to what it can do. It is another path, as I learn to enjoy the journey in the moment. I am not as fit as I used to be, this is different from my normal fitness training. It is becoming less about performance and more about enjoying the experience.
              I try to get to yoga class twice a week, it's a bit harder to achieve now, but it is good to unravel the posture from hovering over a computer and to concentrate the breath. It's all about trying to let go for a short while. My head needs it.
