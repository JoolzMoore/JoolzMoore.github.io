    <h4>Time and habits</h4>
     <p class="blogbody"><strong>Date:</strong> 24 March  <strong> Updated:</strong> 23 May 2016
     <br><br>
     <strong>What timebox and habits have I tried?</strong><br>
     I have known about a technique similar to the pomodoro technique from a sports movement specialist. It is slightly diferent the way I have been practicing. It was suggested I  work in one position for 50 minutes, then do something else for 10 minutes such as hanging out the washing or making a cup of tea. Then re-align the physical working position differently, so trying standing, kneeling, sitting cross-legged moving the laptop and the working environment. It's all about doing what kids do well - wriggle and move alot as being static at a desk is unnatural movement for long periods. It works on a mental scale as well, to create space. We are in an intense period of changing behaviours and creating new habits whilst overloading our brains. Despite some testing - headbanging on the desk hasn't worked as a good mental or physical re-algnment method yet!<br>
     <br>
     <strong>What did I find interesting?</strong><br>
     That the curriculum involves much more than thinking and understanding coding systems. How we work together and the environment fit with our persoanl skills and it all becomes a catalyst for those larger-scale projects we are heading towards. Using holistic thinking, noticing how we react to problems, and realising how we feel, realy does make a difference. It all affects the way we learn. It's all about collaborative coding as a cohort - it's been a good start so far.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>What is working for me? </strong><br>
     I am continually working on it...there is always a much better way. This is my repeat of this phase 0, I was moving around without interenet and without a dedicted work practice in place last time. Repeating this has enabled me to relax, and learn a at a slower pace, and actually enjoy it more. I am also trying to time-block and find larger slabs of time to try to get right into the work. Previously I my work has always fitted around the many family commitments, so often late at night and in the dead early hours of the morning. So we are trying to put i place different family routines to find some uniterrupted times for me to really get into the work.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>What will I experiment further with?. </strong><br>
     I always wondered what the term lizard brain mean't! We have a natural resistance not to stick our necks out. So avoid being afraid to do new stuff, and use any feedback and connections to go further.
