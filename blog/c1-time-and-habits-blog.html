<strong> Which timebox and habits have I tried? </strong>
I have only just read section, it's another brain soak. I have been told about a technique similar to the pomodoro technique from a sports movemnent specialist. It was slightly diferent. I been practicing working in one position for 50 minutes, then do something else for 10 minutes such as hanging out the washing or making a cup of tea. Then re-align the physical working position differently, so trying standing, kneeling, sitting cross-legged moving teh laptop and working environment. 
It's all about doing what kids do well - wriggle and move alot as sitting static at desks is unnatural for long periods. It works on a total mental scale as well. We are in an intense period of changing behaviours and creating new habits whilst overloading our brains. Headbanging on the desk as a re-algnment method hasn't worked so far...

<strong> What did I find interesting? </strong>
I love the work and theories of what our brains and bodies need,and how it affects our learning. I have been reading about this a lot previously. It's great that such holistic thinking is condsidered part of the curriculum. How we feel matters, so let's all try and manage it.

<strong> What is working for me?</strong>
I am continually worling on it...there is always a much better way. As I am moving around the country heaps at the moment finding time and wifi has been a priority, but having the team to call on has been a great asset for me, and is working. Thanks everyone...
So making it big by starting small is my mantra. Getting through stuff when I can. The normal working habits havent been able to be applied, but When I home I'll gradually start introducing new work habits ...

<strong> What will I experiment with further? </strong>
I need to start working ahead and skimming content of next stage when I am stuck, as I waste time in limbo...
Also, do less, but better. I'm gradually trying to shake off other work, community commitments and those family house maintenance jobs in order to cope.
I always wondered what the term 'lizard brainâ€™ meant and our resistance to stick our necks out. Using feedback and connection rather than criticism and opposition is probably the most crucial skill I need to work on!
