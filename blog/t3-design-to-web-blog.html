        <h4> Design to web</h4>
        <p class="blogbody"><strong>Date:</strong> 10 April<strong>  Updated:</strong>  3 June 2016<br><br>
        <strong>What is a responsive site? Why is responsiveness important? </strong>
        A combination of CSS media queries, and flexible media will automatically adapt a website layout and interface to deliver a relevant and focussed user experience not matter what device. For example, a complex three-column layout isn’t going to work very well on a small mobile phone, so when the width of the browser becomes too small, responsive design takes care of this problem by using media queries. Using the latest Web standards will help reduce the fike size of web pages, as users will not neeed to download presentational data with every page visited. Style sheets that control layout are cached in viewers' browsers, so esponsive websites have a faster load, Andd deliver a better user experience. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mobile first design - what is it? Why it's important </strong>
        Mobile usage is continually outstripping other environments and users expect a new level of performance and function on mobile devices. Mobile first design is basically the practice of ensuring that webpages look great and function great for users on mobile and smaller screens as a first step. A small device low bandwidth is a priority to think about as page speed is likely the most important and controllable challenge for a project. A webpage must load fast as too much data - even a split-second’s worth - can have a dramatic impact on load time. It requires thinking about layout and formatting so scrolling to information is easily achieved in an intuitive manner. Focusing on mobile first ensures that you optimise data using mobile features such as geolocation.Mobile first makes considers the usability of design in the design process before aesthetics. From the mobile you move on up, adding more features and content for the desktop environment and then finally considering the high-resolution large displays and the other extremes. This design approach is also known as 'progressive enhancement.'<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What are frameworks? </strong>
        The framework is a number of things, for developers it is a directory holding shared resources, such as a dynamic shared library, related files and code and reference documentation. It is a basic scaffolding framework for building an entire website. In fact the framework doesn’t contain much at all, it has generic code and functions which can be specialised to provide specific designs. Web frameworks are like a bridge to help you code faster and easier, they help to speed up and simplify the development of complex websites. Frameworks are the same as static and dynamic shared libraries, and provide a library of routines that can be called by an application to perform a specific task. Sharing of resources reduces the memory footprint of the system and helps improve performance. CSS and HTML frameworks are often called boilerplates which are used as front-end templates and are based on current best practices. Some examples are: <a href: http://getbootstrap.com/>Bootstrap</a>, <a href:https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/>  Web Starter Kit</a> and <a http://getskeleton.com/> Skeleton.</a> They all add current best practices with basic styling options and responsive layout which enables you to spend more time to focus on what is unique for your project.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The pros of frameworks </strong>
        > Efficiency:
        Tasks that usually would take you hours and hundreds of lines of code to write, can now be done in minutes with pre-built functions such as plug and play workflows that eliminate repetitive tasks (such as manual resets) that you go through each time you begin to setup a site. Development becomes a lot easier, so if it’s easier it’s faster, and consequently efficient. One set of files is written in a universal language, the long term costs of responsive web design are lower than separate websites or apps because there’s less to build and maintain. The frameworkk will deal with the quirks of individual browsers, and deals with the shortcomings of older browsers, by using a basic style.
        > Security:<br>
        Responsive websites are accessed using a device’s web browser, making it universally available, but a widely used framework has big security implementations. The big advantage is the community behind it, where users become long-term testers. If you find a vulnerability or a security hole, you can go to the framework’s website and let the team know so they can fix it.
        > Cost:<br>
        Most popular frameworks are free, and since it also helps the developer to code faster, the cost for the final client will be smaller. Responsive website frameworks operate independently of app-stores. This means no time consuming approval process, strict store rules to adhere to, or the risk of your mobile experience being deleted for an obscure reason. This all makes for good cost effeciencies.
        > Support:<br>
        As any other distributed tool, a framework usually comes with documentation, a support team, and big community forum where you can obtain quick answers. In some website development teams, work is divided into mobile, desktop, front end, back end e-commerce, so creating a disparate and disconnected design and development experience. A framework design demands a intensively collaborative approach across all disciplines from stakeholders, to design, development,content/marketing and end users. A framework brings this all together and sharing a common goal.
        > Consistency:
        Frameworks give you a standard set of selectors that you can use across many sites you build, requiring a consistency for coding. This means if you go back and look at a site you made a year ago, it makes just as as much sense. A user can start a task on one device, and complete it on another, with a familiar interface and layout, including relevant interactions and input gestures such as pinch-to-zoom or swiping.
        > Flexibility:<br>
        Want to try a different design? Maybe add some pages? Change the navigation around a bit? Fix a bug? Responsive framework web design can be updated immediately, and is customisable.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Cons of using frameworks </strong>
        > You could learn the framework, but not the language:<br>
        If you’re using a framework and you know very little about the language behind it, you learn the framework and not the language itself. The way you code jQuery is different from the way you code JavaScript.
        > Limitations and lack of freedom:<br>
        Sometimes the framework’s core behaviour can’t be modified, meaning that when you use a framework, you are forced to respect its limits and work the way it is required. Make sure you choose a framework that suits your needs. Using frameworks can easily lock you into a very narrow way of doing things. Structure is a necessity, but creatively exploring new structures and ways of doing things is a great exercise for developers to keep learning. There will always be a place for organic design structures that break away and find their own usability trail.
        > Code is public:<br>
        Since the framework is available to everyone, it is also available to people with bad intentions. It can be studied in order to know how things work and to find flaws that can be used against you.
        > Extra code:<br>
        If you like code to be clear and concise without any redundancy or unused sections and not turn into bloatware. Most frameworks offer neatly written code, but sometimes you won’t use half of it on a site and there might be some things in there that you're not familiar with. Frameworks intentionally include lots of code for multiple layout scenarios so you pick and choose which selectors you want to use and the others just sit unused. You could sift through the code and delete but that would take time and counteracts the rapid-development reasons you choose to work with a framework.<br>
        > Many sites look the same<br>
        There is an argument that as so many designers have relied on boilerplate frameworks, that many sites are looking alike.<br>
        > Your editing can change defaults which may be an issue with future updates
        If you edit any of the default main.css styles, future versions of boilerplates won't necessarily come across to your site, or may override your own edits. So make use of comments for your own changes, thereby making later comparisons much easier later.<br>

        <strong>What are wireframes and why do we use them?    </strong>
        A wireframe is a visualisation tool or set of images which are used to to design a website service at a structural level. Wireframes are considered the backbone of a design as they contain a simple plan or representation demonstrating what interface elements will exist on key pages. It describes the interaction design process a user experiences and should state clearly:<br>

        > what is there?<br>So the main hierarchy, of content the structure of information.
        <br>

        > where to find it? <br>Demonstrating workflow and a description and basic visualisation that the user experiences.<br>

        > how it works? <br>The interface interaction and description on how every component works with annotated notes.<br>
        <div class="blog_image"><img src="../images/all_wireframes.jpg" alt="" width="80%" height="80%">
            </div>

        Wireframes specifically focus on space allocation and prioritisation of content, functionalities available and the intended user behaviours. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include much styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes are two-dimensional, so interactive features of the interface like drop-downs, hover states that implement or show and hide functionality are further further stage of development for prototyping a website. Wireframes are a communication tool so everyone understands the build process by establishing the fnctionality between a website’s various templates. The wireframe, allows feedback and information on improvements, confirmation of requirements and allows agreement on the project vision and scope before forward onto generating the working mockups.
