      Leadership
      </h4>

     <p class="blogbody"><strong>Date:</strong> 17 July <br><br>
      <strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong><br>
      I have had very genial managers most of the time, but I wanted to recognise a good New Zealand leader. I thought Rob Fyfe handled very compassionately an aeronautical disaster in the very public eye. Rob Fyfe was general manager of Air New Zealand whent he crash of the Air NZ A320 off the coast of France occurred in 2008. It killed four Air NZ staff, a CAA inspector and two German pilots. After the crash, Fyfe was often quite real and emotional in the media. He was an openhearted face for the airline. He immediately took on the media within half an hour of confirming the basic details. Trailed by cameras, he travelled three times within a few months to Perpignan with relatives of the men who died. He did not use any corporate baggage or tout any blame, but took full emotional responsibility. He displayed and communicated how much he felt and that he wanted to help others, and that they were all together in the process. To me he showed the right moral and humane instincts of what can be done in a very respectful way at the very height of the corporate world. <br>

      <strong>  Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong><br>
      It has been also called Neural Self-Hacking (by an engineer at Google), and I can see why. Wow, the brain fills you with good chemical charges when you think hard about cultivating happiness for someone else. Just doing the deep breathing is enough. The big full lung in-breath, the out-breath, helps find the time and space for some good head space. As we focus on the smallest details of breathing, somehow all the crazy worries do go away.  It uses the body the help our brains as we concentrate on others. Creating good cerebal connections with other people, turns our self interest inside-out. It is a win, win for everyone...
    <br>

      <strong>  Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong><br>“Tonglen, in Tibetan means “giving and receiving”, so instead of breathing in goodness, you breathe in suffering (of self and others), and transform it within yourself. I often reflect on all this, and scout the media for international news to understand what is happening to others in tmore difficult parts of the world. I often think about it when I am at a high physical level of uncomfortableness in the middle of nowhere. It is usually in the bracing cold and wet in the middle of the night in a race and I'm super hungry as well. As I am usually in a team and we all try and help each other, and we all know that if keep moving on,  we will get to a sfae place and end it all. These experiences often make you think of people having the same problems, but compounded with lack of direction, often fear, and deep uncertaintly and often with no end in sight. I think of those in war zones, those without status in refugee camps or targeted within their community. They still need their belongings, have to support sick children, look after elderly relatives etc and deserve to find safety and some security. In our family I try to shift our perspective to see other people as human beings with needs that require compassion and understanding. This practice in a deeper level actually makes you feel extroadinarily grateful for the experiences you have been able to have already. <br>

      <strong> How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp? </strong><br>
      Scarf is the five domains of social experience that our brain treats as rewards or threats. How we can use it in EDA for bootcamp:<br>
      <strong>>Status and relative importance</strong>instread of being comparitive, try to use it against yourself, and try to improve over your former selves.<br>
      <strong>>Certainty</strong> mastering our vulnerabilities and turning to certainty and encouragement to help our engagement. <br>
      <strong>>Autonomy </strong> the feeling of of helpessness or control. How we look at the tasks and manage our focus.<br>
      <strong>>Relatedness</strong> what it takes to switch people from foes to friends. For example, getting to know them, and finding their story and sharing information.<br>
      <strong>>Fairness </strong> and our conscience or morality, what is the ethical thing to do? Arm ourselves with knowledge and the right cultural wellbeing. Find out how our friends want to be treated and treat them according to their desires. <br>
      <br>
      <strong> Having a difficult conversation?</strong><br>
      I have had a few. Sometimes it is what I need to do and it has no affect for the other person at all. It was beause the importance was all at my end of the relationship. At other times I have been at the recieving end and have acknowledged how hard it must be for that person. Sometimes you both need to work out what the objective was, and where to now? Does it change everything, how?
      Sometimes you are not part of it, but can see toxic behaviour and have no idea how to tactfully broach or find the real underlying problem. Listening for a long time and enquiring can help. Try to get an understanding of the situation. Recognise emotions without any labelling. Starting the conversation can be a hard task, I don't always get it right. I think doing the goodness meditation first and considering the others perspective maybe a good start from now on. If stuck, I guess ask for help for yourself! <br>
