             <strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? </strong>
             <br>
              II often mention to others to have a go and that the process is everything, but can I adhere to my own advice? I try to do everything as best I can, as outcomes ae important. And as a mum, so many plans are made, but not fulfilled, life happens! Other people have other plans...  I have to remember this course is for me and I should be like the children at preschool -  getting hands all sticky and gooey and covered in the experience of just learning. Enjoy it, at whatever pace, I have to be happy with what I can get done in the time I currently have available. It is about experimenting and learning with everything new.<br>
              <br>

              <strong>Practising mindful conversation </strong>
             <br>
              Listen, listen. Murmer a positive response. It shows that you have listened, and then listen some more. Add in some humanity, valuing others thoughts and lavish on your empathy - the world sure needs a whole lot more. Enjoy the conversation, you will remember it all the more. Your thoughts were concentrated, and not wandering elsewhere, and you were willing to be part of sharing.
