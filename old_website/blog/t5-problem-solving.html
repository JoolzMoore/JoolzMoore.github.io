               <br>It was really the equivalent of moving a mountain - for us it was convincing a large vechicle ship to not leave on time. We were on a weekend cycling holiday in Holland and enjoying our ride back on a Sunday afternoon to catch teh ferry. We had plenty of time, but then we found a cobblestone road that seemed to go on forever. Then we found there was no bridge accross the last canal, but a small passenger ferry <em>and </em> it just left moments before we arrived. This was in the days before mobile phones, but my cycling mate found a phone box, rang the ferry number and explained. They said sorry, you've missed the ferry. So then I tried ringing the number. This time <em>I</em> explained our situation in detail and how we really needed to be back in England on Monday, so had to be on this ferry. The operator was convinced enough to transfer the call, and I was then able to speak directly to the ferry captain - wow! Once again I explained in the best persuasive detail how we had to get on that ship. The captain finally said he could hold back the ferry as they would be able to make-up the time on the crossing. We quickly boarded the next small canal ferry when it arrived and rode onto the overseas ferry  - the gangplank started rising behind us as we were ridig on, there was no time wasted. We made it to work on Monday with a story to tell about the ferry that waited for two cyclists.

              <strong> What is there to learn from this? Quick decision-making, ask for help often often </strong>
              <br>
              OK, so it wasn't a coding problem-solving experience - I am not working on big coding projects, so I haven't got a dramatic solution to write about. So far it is hundreds of small tiny steps. Even if you are trying to move a mountains or small mounds of code, I guess the explaining in detail lesson is the neccesssary bit. We're still learning how to describe and share code experiences. On the cycle trip it was really important to explain precisely why we needed to be back in England. By identifying the issue and making it clear to everyone involved we got on the ferry. The next ferry from Holland wasn't for days, so we would have been stranded for a while. Luckily in Holland, they all seemed to understand English. In this cohort we are all roughly on the same level with coding, and we don't have a myriad of various languages and knowledge separating our coding experiences. I need to learn to talk about every small part of the code so I'm not so left behind. I feel my enquiries for help are way behind the others as they continue on their learning routine. It was huge for me that the ferry captain and phone receptionist broke their normal routine for us to continue our journey, I have never forgotten this. In coding, little urgencies or syntax errors appear from nowhere, and the feedback loop has to be fast. I need to find a faster way to share and get the feedback, so I can continue. What other experiences and what other people do I need to talk to in order to progess with learnig to code? Everyone's learning goes at different paces, mine seems to be at the rear of the pack, but I am still learning. Just like the last runnner in a marathon, it will have to think about my own PB (which is "personal best" for the non-runners reading this!).
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong> What was felt throughout the process? What was learnt?</strong>
              In my example we felt high emotions as we had avoided being stranded in Holland. This is what I need to apply to coding. It shouldn't be different to my other life experiences. On board the ferry years ago, we were full of exhilaration and thankfullness for being able to achieve the unexpected. What you learn is to never give up, keep trying to find an alternative way. When you are really stuck you try almost anything. So I'm  still plodding on with the coding in my own way and hopefully will learn ways to improve as I go.

              <b>> Pseudocode:</b><br>
              This is a new revelation for me as a beginner. I have been taking notes, but sometimes I forget what it all means later. What I needed was a literal translation amongst the code which would translate it, so when I read it again it has it in a strange English, but it makes sense. This is how you often learn languages.
              <br>.
              <br>
              <b>> Just trying something:</b><br>
              Take a bit of code out, does it make a difference? What does the code actually do? Check it out. Console.log it.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>> </b>Reading error messages:<br>
              I've console.logged a whole compilation of short-lined poetry - probably far more elegant than my code. It has lots of repetitive sentences for emphasis, usually including the word error. It is a lesson in going through each section line by line to check thoroughly and work out if it is any of those recurring mistakes that I seem to specialise in, or a new one!

              <b>>
              Ask for help:</b><br>
              Any friend who knows anything remotely web-based has been pestered by me many times now. Neighbours, ex work mates, family, I've tried bribing the co-hort with food and a nice beach to visit, ex EDA students, and saving the best tricky ones for the teachers, as I have no friend left now.... How else am I going to learn? I haven't run out of mistakes and have loads of twisted syntax tangles to unravel yet.

              <b>>
              Goofing it, and then googling it:</b><br>
              Every mistake and error must have been done before, so there can't be anything that is still unGoogled - can there?
              <br>

              Some functions I've googled:
              <br>
              <b>> .map ()</b><br>
              arr.map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results. callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values, including undefined.
              <br>
              <b>> </b>
              .filter( )<br>
              This filter property provides graphical effects like blurring, sharpening, or color shifting an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.
              <br>
              <b>> </b>
              .reduce( )<br>
              The reduce( ) method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right)…left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.
