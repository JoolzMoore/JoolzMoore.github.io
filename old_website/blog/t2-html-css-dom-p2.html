              Grid designs, responsive sites and semantic structure

             <strong>What is grid based design?</strong>
              <br>
              A grid system is a structure comprising a series of horizontal and vertical lines used to arrange content. Grid -based design sees the screen as made up as a flexible grid that you can move objects around in. The grid system is a way of providing a system we can work with to present and structure content and imagery in a manageable way. In a website, both in the front end, and also behind the scenes, there are recommended ways to organise modules and sections of code. A good grid system can help maintain good working experience for developers, ,as well as, a good user experience for customers and clients using the site. Using heirachical elements, and making information flow down in such a way that the site is easy to work with and that users find it easy to navigate, read and understand. <br>
               <br>
              <strong>What is a responsive website? </strong>
              <br>A responsive website responds to the environment where is viewed. The website needs to be responsive to many devices such as touchscreen smartphones, tablets, laptops and large wide-screens. Many devices have different ways of displaying type, images and color through various screen resolutions. To make information responsive it needs to be constructed so all content, images and structure will automatically size to fit to different screen widths and resolution. The re-formatted and adapted interface needs to deliver relevant and focussed user experiences in many different ways. For example, navigation on a small touchscreen device is a very different experience to using a keyboard and or mouse. Often the buttons for touchscreen need to be larger and more widely spaced out than those for mouse clicking, you can’t really hover with touch-screen. So responsive sites often need to tailor the user-interaction to the device they are being viewed on. At the same time t is ideal to make sure all websites display information that is consistent and similar in layout on any device, so a customer or visitor does not get confused. <br>

              <strong>What is semantic structure? </strong>
              <br>
              Semantic structure is a way of organising a language so that it represents a meaning. Semantics are in spoken languages, as well as the programming languages used in web development. When you see a web page, you can generally tell by the design which part of the page is the header (it has the navigation area with links) and which is the footer (with the copyright and other details). But none of the bots, readers, and other programs that need to interpret web pages can 'see' the design. It is necessary to structure the HTML elements in a meaningful and consistent way using tags. The tags use defined classes or ID styles for the main sections of a site with names like "header" and "footer". The code methodically describe the content, rather than how that content should look in order to identify the role and importance of each element on the page in a systematic way.
