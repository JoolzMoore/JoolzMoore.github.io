              What is HTML, CSS and the DOM, and how to boxify
            </h4>
             <p>

             <strong>HTML [Hypertext Markup Language] </strong>
             <br>
              HTML is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a web browser. Each individual markup code is referrenced as elements or tags. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. HTML is like the structure of a building. <br>
              <br>

              <strong>CSS [Cascading Style Sheets] </strong>
              <br>
               CSS describe how the HTML elements are to be displayed. It can control the layout of multiple areas all at once. So for example, CSS is how the structure will look and finally appear. In a building, it would include the final furnishings, paint and exterior materials. It would also include the landscaping, as the environment it sits in is just as important. <br>
               <br>

                <strong>The DOM [Document Object Model] </strong>
                <br>
                The DOM is how all this comes together, and all the parts that are needed to interpret the information to make the structure. The DOM would be like all the information the project planner requires for the building. The project planner would include the blueprints from the architect, information from the builder, plans from the landscaper and interior designer. It takes the relevant information and facilitates the structure to come together in a format the client requires it to be.<br>
                 <br>

                <strong>And so how to boxify? </strong>
                <br>
                A website design is divided into many box elements, we can demonstrate literally, by drawing boxes over elements. To put a website together we need to look at the proposed design and cut it up in to the boxes which contain different elements such as: headings, images, body text, footers, and many other elements. The design is literally how we arrange these elements as boxes for different experience.  <br>
                <br>
                <strong>What is the box model? </strong>
                To describe the website design we use a model that describes every HTML element. Every box works with the box model which uses: margins, borders, padding, as well as the box content. This helps build the underlying the structure when writing the HTML code for the site.
